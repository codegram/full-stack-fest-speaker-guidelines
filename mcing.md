## MCing \[_skip if not MC_\]

A good MC is crucial to the conference, and that is why we chose YOU! We're so glad you've decided to join us ðŸŽ‰

### Your setup

We've prepared a nice, **comfortable backstage** for you with a **TV screen and sound system** where you'll be able to follow the talks. There's gonna be an organizer with you at all times to give you indications and advice on your tasks. It should be a smooth ride!

Your tasks include:

### Welcoming everyone to the conference

The MC is the first person to get on stage. A great power comes with great responsibility! We'll shut the lights off and play the conference's teaser, followed by a voiceover announcing you and asking for a round of applause. You'll then jump on stage and will be in charge of:

* **Welcoming everyone** and setting the mood of the day.
* **Presenting the sponsors** and asking for a round of applause.
* **Reminding** how **lunches** work
* **Reminding** how the **Gap Day** works

We've prepared some slides for you to help you navigate across these bullet points! You'll also have a big remote from the 80s to control them (nice!).

Please **be at the auditorium at 8:30** \(skip the queue, just ask an organizer\) so we can review the slides together!

### Presenting each speaker

It's **good to do a bit of research on the speaker beforehand** in order to present them - they'll be on the backstage just before the talk so you can ask questions yourself.

A nice, funny presentation helps relieve tension and gives the speaker an opportunity to go on stage with a smile!

### Q&A

**Q&A is done via social networks** \(Twitter and a Slack channel\). It'd be great if you could **monitor them and select the best questions** according to your criteria. You'll then ask them to the speaker as if it were an interview. You can even ask questions yourself if you feel like it or there's no questions from the audience \(which is rare but sometimes happens\). We do this because it saves time and because it's often preferred by the speaker.

Sometimes we're a bit off-schedule and we use the Q&A time as a time buffer to adjust, so we might ask you to cut the Q&A altogether \(and let the speaker reply over social networks\).

### Last-minute changes & announcements

The conference has a lot of moving pieces and sometimes we have to adjust schedule or change activity venues. Since just publishing a tweet or updating the website often isn't enough, we use the break announcements to give that information as well.

### Saying farewell

Even though Full Stack Fest it's a big, week-long conference, we treat it as it was two separate ones.

The MC of the back-end block will be saying goodbye to the people that leaves the conference, while the MC of the front-end block will be saying goodbye to everybody.
