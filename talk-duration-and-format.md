## Preparations for your talk

### The auditorium

The conference happens in Auditori AXA. The auditorium has a capacity of 550 people, a big Full HD projector, and a nice, wireless microphone system. It also features very comfortable seating.

Here's how it looks on the inside!

### Audience profile

Our audience is highly diverse - expect experts in all areas, but novices as well. From our point of view, a perfect delivery would have a nice introductory chapter to the topic, followed by an in-depth exploration, with some insightful remarks at the end for the experts in the area.

### About your fellow speaker's talks

We highly encourage you to [check out the conference's schedule](https://2017.fullstackfest.com/agenda/) and read the other talk's summaries - especially those that are before and after yours - to see if you might find any connections that can help you cross-reference them and keep the audience engaged.

We’ve actually laid out the schedule in a way that \(we think\) encourages discussion and continuity between talks!

### Before your talk

Please come to the registration desk \(special entrance on the right part of the auditorium\) when the talk before yours is starting. We’ll walk you to the backstage, where we have a comfortable place with snacks, water & a screen where you can follow the talk. We'll use that time to mic you up and the MC will ask you some questions in order to introduce you. You're welcome to come there earlier if you want to check out the setup!

### Talk duration and format

The talk should be **30min long, with an extra 10min to Q&A**. Regarding the Q&A, it will work as an interview - the audience will throw in questions over Twitter/Slack and the MC will moderate them and then ask them to you. If you need 40min for your talk, we can skip Q&A, but in general it's better to have a slight time buffer in case it takes longer. This can of course be discussed on the backstage prior to the talk.

The projector's resolution is **FullHD**, that is **1920x1080px**. You'll have two screens in front of you during the whole talk mirroring what's projected behind you. In case you need speaker notes, they can't be there for technical reasons - but you'll have a speaker stand as well with a smaller screen mirroring you laptop's main screen.

Your computer will be set up on stage by our technicians, so no mangling with connections will be needed - everything will be done in the background during the Q&A of the previous speaker so the audience won't even notice.

We encourage you to use the available space - walk around the stage, interact with the people, be expressive. That always helps and makes for a more dynamic talk. The attendee’s in general tend to lose interest faster when the speaker’s standing behind the lecter reading notes. It also helps relieving tension and it’s a healthy habit in general ;\) That said, the delivery style is ultimately up to you.

### Captioning

All the talks will be live-captioned for attendees with an impaired hearing or that have difficulty understanding English. Please take that into account - while our captioners are very, very good, a good diction and a relaxed pace always helps \(and will help the audience, too!\).

### Recording

All the talks will be recorded and published for free under a Creative Commons license at our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoOpKfkyCQHW562hXXQAGg/playlists) shortly after the conference \(a couple or weeks or so\).
