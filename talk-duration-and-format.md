## Talk duration and format

The talk should be 30min long, with an extra 10min to Q&A over Twitter/Slack. Regarding the Q&A, it will work as an interview - the audience will throw in questions over Twitter/Slack and the MC will moderate them and then ask them to you. If you need 40min for your talk, we can skip Q&A, but in general it's better to have a slight time buffer in case it takes longer. This can of course be discussed on the backstage prior to the talk.

The projector's resolution is FullHD, that is 1920x1080px. You'll have two monitors in front of you during the whole talk mirroring what's projected behind you. In case you need speaker notes, they can't be there for technical reasons - but you have a speaker stand as well with a smaller screen mirroring you laptop's main screen.

Your computer will be put on stage by our technicians, so no mangling with connections will be needed - everything will be done in the background during the Q&A of the previous speaker so the audience won't even notice.

We encourage you to use the available space - walk around the stage, interact with the people, be expressive. That always helps and makes for a more dynamic talk. The attendee’s in general tend to lose interest faster when the speaker’s standing behind the lecter reading notes. It also helps relieving tension and it’s a healthy habit in general ;\)
