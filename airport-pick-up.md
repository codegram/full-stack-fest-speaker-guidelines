## Transportation

### Airport pick-up

Since we already have your flight details, we'll be waiting for you at the airport. We'll be wearing **red Codegram t-shirts**. Like these:

But don't worry! It's not gonna be all of us in there! Just one or two :\)

We'll help you with your luggage and get you to the hotel. Expect everything from then on to go smoothly!

### Getting back home

Getting back at the airport should be easy via [Aerobus service](http://www.aerobusbcn.com/) or via Taxi \(the hotel is fairly close to the Airport\).

Unfortunately it's not possible for us to bring you there in person \(as we have quite a lot of work to do during and after the conference\) but we'll happily assist you in anything you might need.
