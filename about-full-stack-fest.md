## Full Stack Fest

Full Stack Fest is a conference where we're not afraid to mix technologies & disciplines in an attempt to explore the next breakthroughs.

**Our motto**: "Ideas of today, wonders from the future". **Our main goal**: Get the attendees inspired to try new things.

## Previous editions

[Full Stack Fest 2017](https://2017.fullstackfest.com) is the 7th conference we organize at Codegram. The first of them was **Baruco** \(Barcelona Ruby Conference\) at [2012](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf75BNEHA41k8SkGsssIF6A97), followed by their [2013](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf75GtwxHQzESHqSUgsS0Pv_N) & [2014](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf77DASjRJbHCjGvka_zuJcjz) editions. Then we also organized [FutureJS 2014](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf766JO_B2yHL_JtsfuVDyRR8), although just for a year.

We decided to merge them as we, as a company, shifted from a language-centric approach to a more holistic way of seeing software. We decided to merge & rebrand the both of them as "Full Stack Fest" on [2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf77PgzYZ2yId2RfUkd9_lMMr) & [2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9psSNJBf76DOOKMkDpyo_A5PfZk7JWc), and plan to keep running it on a yearly basis from then on.
