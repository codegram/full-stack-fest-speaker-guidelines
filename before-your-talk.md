## Before your talk

Please come to the registration desk \(special entrance on the right part of the auditorium\) when the talk that comes before yours is starting. Weâ€™ll accompany you to the backstage, where we have a comfortable place with snacks, water & a screen where you can follow the talk. We'll use that time to mic you up and the MC will ask you some questions in order to introduce you. You're welcome to get there earlier if you want to check out the setup!
