### Around the city

If you're from Europe you don't have to worry - you're most probably covered by the European Roaming Regulation, which means that you'll be able to use your regular mobile connection as if you were at home.

In case you're not, you can always get a SIM card at the airport. There's also [Vodafone store close by](https://tiendas.vodafone.es/550-vodafone-diagonal) that has a 4GB data plan for foreigners.

There's also a public, city-wide **WiFi** available for free, but tends to be a bit unreliable, so a mobile data plan still is the preferred option.

### At the auditorium

During the conference, there's a private speakers WiFi available. You'll have access to it during the whole event, and also from the stage. Just ask for the name and password upon arrival.
