## ðŸ“¡ Connectivity

### Around the city

Barcelona is covered by a good 4G connection, but getting a SIM card requires registration with your personal information and can take a while. We encourage you to get it on a store once you're settled at the hotel.

There's a [Vodafone store close by](https://tiendas.vodafone.es/550-vodafone-diagonal) that has a 4GB data plan for 15EUR.

There's also a public, city-wide **WiFi** available for free, but tends to be a bit unreliable, so a mobile data plan still is the preferred option.

### At the auditorium

During the conference, there's a private speakers WiFi available. You'll have access to it during the whole event, and also from the stage. Just ask for the name and password upon arrival.
