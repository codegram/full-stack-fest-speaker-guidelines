## Connectivity

### Getting a SIM card

Barcelona is covered by a good 4G connection, but getting a SIM card can take a while and we encourage you to get it on a store once you're at the airport.

There's a [Vodafone store close by](https://tiendas.vodafone.es/550-vodafone-diagonal) that has a 4GB data plan for 15EUR.

### On the auditorium

During the conference, there's a private speakers WiFi available. You'll have access to it during the whole event, and also from the stage. Just ask for the name and password upon arrival.
