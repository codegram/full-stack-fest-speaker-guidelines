## Recommendation for a more inclusive language

In order to ensure a safe experience for everyone on the audience, we'd like to ask you to be mindful about the language. In this regard, we particularly like the [guidelines given by CSSConf](http://2016.cssconf.com.au/codeofconduct/), but we’re open to suggestions. In that case, please send them to us and we’ll include them.

### Ableism

Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of ableist language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

### Sexism

Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
