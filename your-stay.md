It's barely a minute walk throught the park from the Auditorium, so it'll be really easy for you to get there if you need to.

### Speaker's dinner

Just the day before each of the conference's block (Sept, 3 for backend speakers and Sept 6 for front-end speakers) we'll throw a speaker's dinner.

It'll give you the chance to get to know other speakers while having a really nice menu at the [Hilton Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/3A2z53jfG2t).

**Details pending**

### Other meals

A really nice **breakfast buffet is included** in the hotel and it's served from 7-10am. **Coffee and snacks** will be served during the conference, and **lunch is included as well on nearby restaurants** - look for the lunch tickets on the welcome bag. You'll be able to choose from a wide range of restaurants in the area covering most food allergies and dietary restrictions.
