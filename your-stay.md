### Speaker's dinner

Just the day before each of the conference's block (Sept, 3 for backend speakers and Sept 6 for front-end speakers) we'll throw a speaker's dinner.

It'll give you the chance to get to know other speakers while having a really nice menu at the Hilton Hotel.

We'll meet at **Hotel NH Barelona Les Corts hall at 19:30**.

### Other meals

**Breakfast is included** in the stay and it's served from 7-10am. **Coffee and snacks** will be served during the conference, and **lunch is included as well on nearby restaurants** - look for the lunch tickets on the welcome bag. You'll be able to choose from a wide range of restaurants in the area covering most food allergies and dietary restrictions.
