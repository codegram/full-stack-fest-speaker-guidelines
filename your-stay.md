## Accomodation & meals

### Your stay

You'll be staying at [Hotel NH Barcelona Les Corts](). Our crew will pick you up at the airport and help you with the check in.

It's barely a 3 minute walk from the Auditorium, so it'll be really easy for you to get there if you need to.

### Speaker's dinner

Just the day before each of the conference's block (Sept, 3 for backend speakers and Sept 6 for front-end speakers) we'll throw a speaker's dinner.

It'll give you the chance to get to know other speakers while having a really nice menu at the Hilton Hotel.

We'll meet at **Hotel NH Barelona Les Corts hall at 20:00**.

### Other meals

**Breakfast is included** in the stay and it's served from 7-10am. **Coffee and snacks** will be served during the conference, and **lunch is included as well on nearby restaurants** - look for the lunch tickets included in the reservation. You'll be able to choose from a wide range of restaurants in the area covering most food allergies and dietary restrictions.
