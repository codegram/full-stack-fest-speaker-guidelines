## About your fellow speaker's talks

We highly encourage you to [check out the conference's schedule](https://2017.fullstackfest.com/agenda/) and read the other talk's summaries - especially those that are before and after yours - to see if you might find any connections that can help you cross-reference them and keep the audience engaged. Weâ€™ve actually laid out the schedule in a way that (we think) encourages discussion and continuity between talks.
