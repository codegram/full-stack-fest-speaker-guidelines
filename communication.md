# Communication

Before anything else, we should get sure both sides have clear ways to get in touch with each other.

## Chat Channel via [Slack](https://slack.com)

We've set up a private slack channel for speakers where you all can meet and exchange ideas & thoughts about the conference. There's also some general channels where attendees can enter to discuss talks, ask questions, & make plans for the Gap Day.

You can join it via this link:

[http://chat.fullstackfest.com/](http://chat.fullstackfest.com/)

Just register in Slack and enter the **\#general** channel. Weâ€™ll invite you to the private **\#speakers2017** channel once we see you there!
