# Full Stack Fest's Speaker Guidelines & Recommendations

# Slack Channel

We've set up a private slack channel for speakers where you all can meet and exchange ideas & thoughts about the conference. You can join it via this link:

[http://chat.fullstackfest.com/](http://chat.fullstackfest.com/)

Just register into slack and enter the _\#general_ channel. We’ll invite you to the private _\#speakers2017_ one when we see you land there!

## Companion talks

We highly encourage you to [check out the conference's schedule](https://2017.fullstackfest.com/agenda/) and read the other talk's summaries - especially those that are before and after yours - to see if you might find any connections that can help you cross-reference them and keep the audience engaged. We’ve actually laid off the schedule in a way that \(we think\) encourages discussion between talks.

## Before your talk

Please come to the registration desk \(special entrance on the right part of the auditorium\) when the talk that comes before yours is starting. We’ll accompany you to the backstage, where we have a comfortable place with snacks, water & a screen where you can follow the talk. We'll use that time to mic you up and the MC will ask you some questions in order to introduce you. You're welcome to get there earlier if you want to check out the setup!

## Audience profile

Our audience is highly diverse - expect experts in all areas, but novices as well. From our point of view, a perfect delivery would have a nice introductory chapter to the topic, followed by an in-depth exploration, with some insightful remarks at the end for the experts in the area.

## Talk duration and format

The talk should be 30min long, with an extra 10min to Q&A over Twitter/Slack. Regarding the Q&A, it will work as an interview - the audience will throw in questions over Twitter/Slack and the MC will moderate them and then ask them to you. If you need 40min for your talk, we can skip Q&A, but in general it's better to have a slight time buffer in case it takes longer. This can of course be discussed on the backstage prior to the talk.

The projector's resolution is FullHD, that is 1920x1080px. You'll have two monitors in front of you during the whole talk mirroring what's projected behind you. In case you need speaker notes, they can't be there for technical reasons - but you have a speaker stand as well with a smaller screen mirroring you laptop's main screen.

Your computer will be put on stage by our technicians, so no mangling with connections will be needed - everything will be done in the background during the Q&A of the previous speaker so the audience won't even notice.

We encourage you to use the available space - walk around the stage, interact with the people, be expressive. That always helps and makes for a more dynamic talk. The attendee’s in general tend to lose interest faster when the speaker’s standing behind the lecter reading notes. It also helps relieving tension and it’s a healthy habit in general ;\)

## Captioning

All the talks will be live-captioned for attendees with an impaired hearing or that have difficulty understanding English. Please take that into account - while our captioners are very, very good, a good diction and a relaxed pace always helps \(and will help the audience, too!\).

## Recommendation for a more inclusive language

In order to ensure a safe experience for everyone on the audience, we'd like to ask you to be mindful about the language. In this regard, we particularly like the [guidelines given by CSSConf](http://2016.cssconf.com.au/codeofconduct/), but we’re open to suggestions. In that case, please send them to us and we’ll include them.

### Ableism

Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of ableist language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

### Sexism

Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
