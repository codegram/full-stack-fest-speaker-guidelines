# Slack Channel

We've set up a private slack channel for speakers where you all can meet and exchange ideas & thoughts about the conference. You can join it via this link:

[http://chat.fullstackfest.com/](http://chat.fullstackfest.com/)

Just register into slack and enter the _\#general_ channel. Weâ€™ll invite you to the private _\#speakers2017_ one when we see you land there!
