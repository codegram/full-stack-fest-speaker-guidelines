## Companion talks

We highly encourage you to [check out the conference's schedule](https://2017.fullstackfest.com/agenda/) and read the other talk's summaries - especially those that are before and after yours - to see if you might find any connections that can help you cross-reference them and keep the audience engaged. Weâ€™ve actually laid off the schedule in a way that \(we think\) encourages discussion between talks.
