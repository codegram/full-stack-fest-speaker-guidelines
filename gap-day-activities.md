![](/assets/gap-day.jpg)

The conference is divided in two blocks - back-end and front-end, divided by what we call the **Gap Day**. During the Gap Day, attendees & speakers are encouraged to get out of the auditorium and perform activities that help them relax, let the knowledge sink in, and get to meet each other.

We're still planning the **Gap Day. **We'll soon let you know the activities!
