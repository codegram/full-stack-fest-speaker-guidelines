## ðŸŒ´ Gap day activities

The conference is divided in two blocks - back-end and front-end, divided by what we call the **Gap Day**. During the Gap Day, attendees & speakers are encouraged to get out of the auditorium and perform activities that help them relax, let the knowledge sink in, and get to meet each other.

We've prepared plenty of activities during the **Gap Day**, including Kite Surfing, a run by the beach, a volleyball competition, escape rooms, tapas & wine tours, and much more! Our sponsors have also prepared workshops on the **Hack Room**.

It's an incredibly fun and rewarding experience. [Check them out](https://ti.to/codegram/full-stack-fest-2017-gap-day)!
